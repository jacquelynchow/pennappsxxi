# Nite :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Write
A speech-to-text diary to get those end-of-the-day thoughts out. A right night is a night with NiteWrite!

## Inspiration
**A lot of people have stressful things on their mind right now.** [According to a Boston University study, "depression symptom prevalence was more than 3-fold higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than before."](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2770146)
Sometimes it’s hard to sleep or get a good night’s rest because of what happened that day. If you say or write everything down, it helps get it out of your mind so you’re not constantly thinking about it. Diaries take a long time to write in, and sometimes you want to talk. **Voice diaries aren't common and they are quicker and easier to use than a real diary.**

## What it does
When you're too tired to write out your thoughts at the end of the day, **you can simply talk aloud and our app will write it down for you, easy right?**

Nite Write asks you questions to get you thinking about your day. It listens to you while you speak. You can take breaks and continue speaking to the app. You can go back and look at old posts and reflect on your days!

## How we built it
- We used **Figma** to plan out the design and flow of our web app.
- We used **WebSpeech API** and **JavaScript** to hook up the speech-to-text transcription.
- We used **HTML** and **CSS** for the front-end of the web app. 
- And lastly, we used **Flask** to put the entire app together.

## Challenges we ran into
Our first challenge was understanding how to use Flask both in its usage of routes, templates, and syntax. Another challenge was the lack of time and integrating the different parts of the app because we're virtual. It was difficult to coordinate and use our time efficiently since we lived all over the country in different timezones. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
**We are proud of being able to come together virtually to address this problem we all had!**

## What we learned
We learned how to use Flask, WebSpeech API, and CSS. We also learned how to put together a demo with slides, work together virtually.

## What's next for Nite Write?
- Show summaries and trends on a person's most frequent entry topics or emotion
- Search feature that filters your diary entries based on certain words you used
- Light Mode feature
- Ability to sort entries based on topic/etc
